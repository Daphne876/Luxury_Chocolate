# Luxury_Chocolate

# Context
I will be exploring ratings of luxury chocolates. The main purpose of this analysis is to use python to create geographical visualizations, use supervised machine learning for regression and clustering, and analyze time series data. 

# Objective
The questions I will be exploring in this analysis are
- Does the specific origin of cocoa beans affect a chocolate bar’s rating?
- Does the broad origin of cocoa beans affect a chocolate bar’s rating?
- Is there a specific company that produces the highest-rated chocolate bars?
- Does a company’s base country affect the ratings of their chocolate bars, or do
  companies based in specific countries have higher ratings than others?
- Do the average ratings change over time?

# Data
This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 chocolate bars. The data set is sourced from Kaggle. These ratings were compiled by a founding member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, Brady Brelinski. I chose to study this data set because I am curious if cocoa bean origin and the region of the manufacturer make a difference in rating.
Rating system:
5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character, and style)
3= Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities) 2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)
